# MENET for feature extraction in Abstract Visual Reasoning task #

The repo is a implementation of Improved MRNET based Network to solve Raven's progressive matrices. We use I-RAVEN dataset for this task, and we also compare this novel approach with previously applied model architectures.

It was a part of a Machine learning project with baseline models and proposed model implementation
